## [Documentation](https://github.com/streamreasoning/rsplab/wiki)

RSP Lab aims at being the a full stack development environment for RSP Engines.
To this extent, we started by realizing a platform that will support research in RSP by simplifying one of the hardest tasks: the evaluation.

## Streamer
This repository **currently** contains two benchmarks CityBench and LSBench.
For each benchmark we provide:  
    - A domain description.
    - A description of the data, i.e. Ontologies and Streams or generators.
    - The queries as they are provided.
    - A set of scripts used to elaborate on the benchmark data and made them available for the RSP Lab suite
